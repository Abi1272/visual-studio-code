	<p>Do you like cats? Well, lucky for you, cats are domesticated pets, meaning you can own one. Cats tend to be small, but they aren't always small as they can be fed too much, making them really huge! While cats are sociable animals, they can also be independent. This is due to their amazing adaptability skills. Remember, just because pets can be independent does not mean you should not take care of them. Take care of your pets! Cats, also known as gatos, have a variety of colors, and some are fluffy while others are hairless.</p>
